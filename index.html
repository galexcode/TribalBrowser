<p>Download the installer <a href="http://www.udaiyan.com/frugaldisruptive/SetupTribalBrowser.exe">here</a>.</p>

<p>Welcome to Frugal Disruptive's Open Source project: Tribal Browser. Humans are Tribal. They are interested in their own ideas and similar ideas from people that agree with those general leanings. The Tribes are infinite and have various names such as: Anarchist, Christian, Conceptual Artists, Republicans. If you're surfing the net as Socialist and want to read the news - you won't really be interested in news sites of a certain right wing character. Likewise - if you're a Christian - you don't want to search for Biblical quotes and be bombarded with dodgy sites. </p>

<h3>
<a name="the-problem" class="anchor" href="#the-problem"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The problem</h3>

<p>The problem is this: using your average search engine - you search for a term: say: 'Art' and you get back over 5 billion hits. That's all very good - but it's not really what you want. The top hits are sites that have either been paid for - or play the system by having as many links to them as possible. What you really want is to just show the 10-20 sites that you and your friends (or fellow tribe members) are into. </p>

<p>The next problem is this: every site has a URL like : http//<a href="http://www.SomeNameThatsBeenBoughtUp.com">www.SomeNameThatsBeenBoughtUp.com</a>. Once someone has bought that name - no-one else can use it. In a free society I want to assign my own names to the sites I like - and not just use Latin characters but others like Arabic, Hebrew, Mandarin, Sanskrit. Why can't we (the people) just create our own mappings to URLs or IP address and then when other Tribe members join my tribe - just see our collective sites. What I'm talking about is bypassing ICANN and freeing up their monopoly and handing it back to the people.</p>

<h3>
<a name="the-solution" class="anchor" href="#the-solution"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Solution</h3>

<p>The solution is this. Tribal Browser is a wrapper around your browser which allows the user to create their own tribes or join exiting ones. Once you are in a Tribe you can then map your own sites to URLs or IP addresses - which can then be seen by other fellow Tribe members. Basically you can then create your own internet with addresses set by you or your tribe. You can then search and see things that you and your fellow tribe members are into. </p>

<p>The steps you take are this simple:</p>

<pre><code>1. Open Tribal Browser
2. Join a Tribe (or create your own)
3. Create your own mappings to sites or IP addresses: e.g. Art -&gt; www.udaiyan.com
4. Once that is done the mapped sites are visible to all your fellow tribe members.
5. You can even chat to fellow members who are logged in: IRC style.
6. The sites you map for your tribe are stored on the cloud â€“ so they are available to any tribe member throughout the world.

<a name="code-and-dependencies" class="anchor" href="#code-and-dependencies"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code and dependencies.</h3>

<p>The code is written in C# - All you need to compile is Microsoft's Visual C# 2010 Express edition. 
You also need the MongoDB C# driver - but that is already supplied in the repository and referenced in the project. </p>
